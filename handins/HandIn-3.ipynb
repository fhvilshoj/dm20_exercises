    "# Hand In 3 - Frequent Itemsets, Random Walks and Sequence Segmentation\n",
    "Due: May 15th 2020, 23:59\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a mandatory handin to be done in groups of 2-3 students, who shall submit:\n",
    "1. A report in **PDF format**. The report should contain your experimental results; and\n",
    "2. Python code in a zip-file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pdf should **not** be in the zip-file and your report should **not** be a part of the python code. \n",
    "In other words, your report should be self-contained and your code should be there to document\n",
    "that you actually did what you claim :-).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission should be done in Blackboard by **May 15th 23.59**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1 - Frequent Itemsets\n",
    "We have learned the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for mining frequent itemsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop an implementation of both.\n",
    "2. Run an experiment and show to what extent FP-Growth has an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain the anonymized real-world `retail market basket` data from: http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/.\n",
    "This data comes from an anonymous Belgian retail store, and was donated by Tom Brijs from Limburgs Universitair Centrum, Belgium. The original data contains 16,470 different items and 88,162 transactions. You may only work with the top-50 items in terms of occurrence frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint:_ We have used this dataset before.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2 - Random Walks\n",
    "We introduced the notion of hitting time, as the expected length of a random walk \n",
    "between two nodes; the expected number of steps before a simple random walk starting \n",
    "from a vertex $v$ reaches a vertex $u$. Your present task is to compute the average \n",
    "hitting time in the \n",
    "`cit-DBLP` dataset from the [citation dataset collection](http://networkrepository.com/cit.php) \n",
    "in the [Network Repository](http://networkrepository.com/networks.php).\n",
    "Here, average is defined across all pairs of nodes, considered in both directions. \n",
    "You may ignore pairs that are not connected by a (directed) path. \n",
    "Implement an algorithm that computes this average hitting time and report your \n",
    "result.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint:_ We have used this dataset before.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3 - Sequence Segmentation\n",
    "The Dynamic Programming algorithm for optimally segmenting a sequence $S$ of length $n$ \n",
    "into $B$ segments, that we have introduced, is expressed by the following recursive equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(i, b) = \\min_{j < i}\\left[ E(j, b-1) + Err(j+1, i)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Err(j+1, i)$ is the error of a segment that contains items from $j+1$ to $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. What is the default space-complexity of this algorithm?\n",
    "2. If we are willing to recompute some tabulated results, can we then reduce the \n",
    "    default space-complexity? _Exactly how_? What is the space-complexity then?\n",
    "3. What is the cost of using the above space-efficiency technique in terms of time-complexity?\n",
    "4. For the sub-problem of segmenting the $i$-prefix of sequence $S$ into $b$ segments, consider \n",
    "    the segment $M(i, b)$ that contains (if such segment exists) the middle item of \n",
    "    index $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$. The boundaries of $M(i, b)$ can be detected and tabulated \n",
    "    along with each $E(i, b)$ solution. Based on this observation, devise a method that reduces \n",
    "    the time-complexity burden identified in (3). \n",
    "    _(hint: use [divide-and-conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm))_\n",
    "5. What is the time complexity when using the technique proposed in (4)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** \n",
    "As this is the final handin and we are getting close to the exam, rehandins are not an option.\n",
    "Therefor, we strongly encourage you to get started early and if you get too stuck, make sure\n",
    "to send Frederik an email early (not right up to the deadline). For a faster reply, use\n",
    "[fhvilshoj@cs.au.dk](mailto:fhvilshoj@cs.au.dk) and **not** ~201206000@ post.au.dk~. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you, who are not used to analyzing algorithms: by time-complexity and space-complexity, \n",
    "we refer to the theoretical computation time and memory usage, respectively, as a function of the problem size, i.e., as a \n",
    "function of $n$ and $B$ in Problem 3. We use [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)\n",
    "to specify this. You should **not** infer it by implementing it in practice ;-) \n",
    "Again, when in doubt, shoot Frederik an email. "
